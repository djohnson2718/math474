    "# Lab 4: Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "* To build a dense prediction model\n",
    "* To begin reading current papers in DNN research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable\n",
    "For this lab, you will turn in a notebook that describes your efforts at creating\n",
    "a pytorch radiologist. Your final deliverable is a notebook that has (1) a deep network,\n",
    "(2) method of calculating accuracy, \n",
    "(3) images that show the dense prediction produced by your network on the pos_test_000072.png image (index 172 in the validation dataset).\n",
    "This is an image in the test set that your network will not have seen before.\n",
    "This image, and the ground truth labeling, is shown below.\n",
    "(And is contained in the downloadable dataset below).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading standards\n",
    "Your notebook will be graded on the following:\n",
    "* 40% Proper design, creation and debugging of a dense prediction network\n",
    "* 20% Proper implementation of train/test set accuracy measure\n",
    "* 20% Tidy visualizations of loss of your dense predictor during training\n",
    "* 20% Test image output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set\n",
    "The data is given as a set of 1024×1024 PNG images. Each input image (in \n",
    "the ```inputs``` directory) is an RGB image of a section of tissue,\n",
    "and there a file with the same name (in the ```outputs``` directory) \n",
    "that has a dense labeling of whether or not a section of tissue is cancerous\n",
    "(white pixels mean “cancerous”, while black pixels mean “not cancerous”).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been pre-split for you into test and training splits.\n",
    "Filenames also reflect whether or not the image has any cancer at all \n",
    "(files starting with ```pos_``` have some cancerous pixels, while files \n",
    "starting with ```neg_``` have no cancer anywhere).\n",
    "All of the data is hand-labeled, so the dataset is not very large.\n",
    "That means that overfitting is a real possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "For a video including some tips and tricks that can help with this lab: [https://youtu.be/Ms19kgK_D8w](https://youtu.be/Ms19kgK_D8w)\n",
    "For this lab, you will implement a virtual radiologist.\n",
    "You are given images of possibly cancerous tissue samples, \n",

    "Implement a dense predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs and lectures, we have talked about DNNs that classify an \n",
    "entire image as a single class. Here, however, we are interested in a more nuanced classification: \n",
    "given an input image, we would like to identify each pixel that is possibly cancerous. \n",
    "That means that instead of a single output, your network should output an “image”, \n",
    "where each output pixel of your network represents the probability that a pixel is cancerous.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Implement your network topology\n",

    "\n",
    "You should use existing pytorch functions (not your own Conv2D module), such as ```nn.Conv2d``` and ```nn.CrossEntropyLoss```;\n",
    "you will also need the pytorch function ```torch.cat``` and ```nn.ConvTranspose2d```\n",
    "\n",
    "```torch.cat``` allows you to concatenate tensors.\n",
    "```nn.ConvTranspose2d``` is the opposite of ```nn.Conv2d```.\n",
    "It is used to bring an image from low res to higher res.\n",
    "[This blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/up-sampling-with-transposed-convolution-9ae4f2df52d0) should help you understand this function in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simplify the implementation of this lab by padding the feature maps as they pass through each convolution. This will make the concatenation process easier, though this is technically a departure from the cropping technique outlined in the orginal U-Net paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the simplest network you could implement (with all the desired properties)\n",
    "is just a single convolution layer with two filters and no relu! \n",
    "Why is that? (of course it wouldn't work very well!)\n",
    "\n",
